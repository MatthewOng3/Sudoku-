# Sudoku-
Playable sudoku game using python and pygame with an inbuilt backtracking algorithm that solves the board on its own. Currently you need to edit the board array 
in the file itself to change the starting board, hope to make the program able to scan a sudoku image in the future.
How to play:
Click on which square you want to input a number on, clicked square is indicated by a red border.
Use either the numpad on the keyboard or just the normal number keys to input a desired number. It will appear faded in grey which indicates a possible value, 
hit enter to finalise the value and it will enter the number officially. Timer is displayed on the bottom right hand corner to time how fast you are able to solve 
it.
Hit space to activate the backtracking algorithm and have the program solve the board algorithmically.
