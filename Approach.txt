Notes:
- 0 represent empty space on board
- Use python sets to represent each row and col and grid?
- The call stack remembers our choices and knows what to choose next
- Backtracking is a method to solve problems by making a series of choices that we can return to or backtrack to
- Main solve function follows a pattern:
   1) Make a choice
   2) Explore that choice
   3) Unchoose that choice
- Each recursion expresses a Decision

CHOICES:
- Decision space ( 1 to 9)

CONSTRAINTS:
- Check if number already exists in the 3x3 grid, row and column

GOAL:
- Once the entire board is filled and no empty position is found
